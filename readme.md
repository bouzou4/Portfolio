# My Portfolio

#### Start with NPM script
###### For Development:
Run the start script to compile website through webpack.

Client bundle available in memory at dist/bundle.js 

`npm run start`


## Code 

Large majority of code is written in ES6+ through config, server and source

### React App
React App contained in src/components folder.

#### Sublime Editor
[editorconfig](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime)


## Viewing Site

### Pre-Compiled
